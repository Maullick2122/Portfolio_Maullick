    <p class="P1">
        I am Maullick Pushkarna, I would like to describe myself as a 3D generalist and concept artist with an inclination towards texturing, lighting, assembling and cinematics of an animation. 
        Some of the projects that I have done in my time at university are under the projects page.
    </p>
</br>
<p class="P1">
    I have also developed work for VR headsets, mainly the Meta Quest 2 i.e project for the SDGs and also worked on the unconventional convention which entailed team building exercises through the use of immersive technologies.
    I currently work a part time at Coventry University as a student proctor where I work in immersive. 
    This includes being technically adept with VR, AR and XR development softwares and also, using MO-CAP rigs like Shogun by Vicon.
