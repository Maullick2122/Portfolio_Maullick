    <p class="P1">
        I am Maullick Pushkarna, I would like to describe myself as a 3D generalist focusing on conceptualisation and narrative design with techinical inclination towards modelling, lighting, assembling and cinematics of an animation. 
        Some of the projects that I have done are under the projects page.
    </p>

<p class="P1">
    I have also developed immersive work using VR and AR, mainly the Meta Quests i.e project for the SDGs and also worked on the unconventional convention which entailed team building exercises through the use of immersive technologies.
    I currently work a part time at Coventry University as an assitant lecturer where I work in immersive. 
    This includes being technically adept with VR, AR and XR development softwares and also, using MO-CAP rigs like Shogun by Vicon along with game ngine and animated film production knowledge.
